# Jordson's documentation and translations.

All Jordson documentation and contribute to the translation. You can follow the current [RoadMap](https://github.com/orgs/jordson-io/projects/4).

## How to contribute ?

Select the branch corresponding to the major version and then you can either propose a correction or a new translation.

- [Aegir-Unstable](https://github.com/jordson-io/jordson-docs-i18n/tree/aegir-unstable)

For any new translation you have to create a folder with the code of the desired language (ex. de-de for german). Then you have to translate and add the corresponding files and subfolders. It is recommended to use the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify) documentation

## Any Problem ?

You can open [new issue](https://github.com/jordson-io/jordson-docs-i18n/issues)
