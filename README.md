For any new translation you have to create a folder with the code of the desired language (ex. de-de for german). Then you have to translate and add the corresponding files and subfolders. It is recommended to use the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify) documentation

## Any Problem ?

You can open [new issue](https://github.com/jordson-io/jordson-docs-i18n/issues)
